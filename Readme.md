# omnigollum - omniauth meets gollum

## ACL enabled version by Akretion

We extended Omnigollum to support ACL on CRUD (create, read, update, delete) actions.

By default ACL checking is disabled and it behaves as the original omnigollum version where create, update and delete actions require a login and that login may belong to a restricted list of enabled authors.

To activate the ACL instead, you should set the :check_acl option to true in the options you pass to Gollum:

    options = {
       ...
       :check_acl => true
    }


Access rights are set in an auth.md file at any level of the directories hierarchy
using the standard markdown embedded Yaml metadata syntax.
The advantage of this is that one can easily grant or revoke permissions just by editing an auth.md wiki page if allowed to do so.
For instance:

    <!--
    ---
    :read:
    - group1
    - group2
    - foo@akretion.com
    - bar@akretion.com
    - baz@akretion.com
    - /(.*)@akretion.com$/
    :update:
    - foo@akretion.com
    - group1
    -->

Notice that you can grant rights individually or as a group. You can also use a regexp syntax like
/(.*)@akretion.com$/ to enable any user which email ends with @akretion.com.

By default user groups are passed as a hardcoded option in your config.ru file.
See the example in the 'Set configuration' section below.
But you may very well override the get_groups method to implement any backend you want.

Special groups (this is inspired from MoinMoin ACL http://moinmo.in/HelpOnAccessControlLists)

  - All: all users can do the action. Useful to enable anonymous read in some directory.
  - Known: any logged user.

Finally, permissions are checked from the root of the wiki to the sub-folder of the current page.
This makes it possible to give access to any subfolder of a given subfolder or on the contrary give access only to a given sub-folder.

The following part of the documentation is the one of the original forked project, except for the additional user groups option in the example configuration.


## Quick Installation/Configuration

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/chris2fr/omnigollum.git
$ cd omnigollum
$ gem build omnigollum.gemspec
$ gem install omnigollum*.gem
```

```sh
$ cp config.rb.example config.rb
```
Customize config.rb to use your preferred omniauth strategy.

Execute via Gollum
```sh
$ gollum --config config.rb
```

## Installation
```sh
$ gem install omnigollum
```

## Configuration

Omnigollum executes an OmniAuth::Builder proc/block to figure out which providers you've configured,
then passes it on to omniauth to create the actual omniauth configuration.

To configure both omniauth and omnigollum you should add the following to your config.ru file.

### Load omnigollum library
```ruby
require 'omnigollum'
```

### Load individual provider libraries
```ruby
require 'omniauth/strategies/twitter'
require 'omniauth/strategies/open_id'
```

### Set configuration
```ruby
options = {
  # OmniAuth::Builder block is passed as a proc
  :providers => Proc.new do
    provider :twitter, 'CONSUMER_KEY', 'CONSUMER_SECRET'
    provider :open_id, OpenID::Store::Filesystem.new('/tmp')
  end,
  :dummy_auth => false
  :check_acl => true, # enable ACL checking (default is disabled)
  :groups => {:group1 => ['foo@akretion.com', 'bar@akretion.com'], :group2 =>['bar@akretion.com', 'baz@akretion.com']}
}

# :omnigollum options *must* be set before the Omnigollum extension is registered
Precious::App.set(:omnigollum, options)
```

### Access control

By default, any authenticated user will be able to access the protected routes. Restrict this by setting the `authorized_users` option.

`authorized_users` accepts an array of emails. Users must authenticate with one of these authorized emails in order to be allowed access.

```ruby
options[:authorized_users] = ["example0@example.org", "example1@example.org", "example2@example.org"]
```

Instead of setting these directly, you can use an env var, maybe like this:

```ruby
# in .env, or other
# OMNIGOLLUM_AUTHORIZED_USERS=example0@example.org,example1@example.org,example2@example.org

options[:authorized_users] = ENV["OMNIGOLLUM_AUTHORIZED_USERS"].split(",")
```

### Register omnigollum extension with sinatra
```ruby
Precious::App.register Omnigollum::Sinatra
```

## Required patches

### Gollum
You can (optionally) apply the patches here, to get a neat little auth
status widget in the top right corner of the page https://github.com/arr2036/gollum/commit/dd1fdad59d9f12bfe637704c0101af96aaa1a7e4
